Elation Mail Account Management Component

This component provides an administrative interface to a database-backed virtual mail system which makes it easy to manage email accounts and forwards for any number of domains.  It is intended to be run as within the Elation framework.

Currently this setup is in use with postfix+dovecot+mysql, and configuration files are included for that combination.  This schema should work with most servers (SMTP/IMAP/POP3) which support database-driven virtual hosting - if you want to use it on a different setup, we'd be happy to accept configuration files for other servers.

Installation
============

This setup is loosely based on the setup described in http://johnny.chadda.se/article/mail-server-howto-postfix-and-dovecot-with-mysql-and-tlsssl-postgrey-and-dspam/ (or possibly an earlier version).  It's recommended you read through that while performing any setup of the various software packges, as it's likely they have more detailed information than is available here.

Postfix:
    $ cp -r config/postfix/vmail /etc/postfix
    $ chmod 600 /etc/postfix/vmail/*

    Then, manually merge changes from config/postfix/main.cf-additions into /etc/postfix/main.cf

Dovecot:
    $ cp config/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf /etc/dovecot/

    Then, manually merge changes from config/dovecot/dovecot.conf-additions into /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf
